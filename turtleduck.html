			<p>The first project in our Fundamentals of Robotics class involved working on a team with five other students of various backgrounds to design, build, and program an autonomously navigating animal-inspired boat. The main constraint was that we couldn’t use propellers and had to come up with a different propulsion system from the materials given. The boat would have to sense the walls of the circular pool and turn before hitting the wall. Our group decided we would model our boat off of a Turtle Duck (think body of a turtle with a duck’s head and flippers). I worked on the design and manufacturing of mechanical control, focusing on the turning mechanism. I decided to take inspiration from kayak ores and steer the Turtle Duck with large, flat flippers that lowered into the water to provide resistance on one side, causing the boat to turn in that direction. These flippers were powered by two individual servos that were firmly attached to the sides of the Turtle Duck using custom 3D-printed mounts and heated thread inserts. I also helped design the water intake system that pulled in water from the front of the boat and pushed it out the back with a small bilge pump. The rear output of water stream was controlled with a 3D-printed piece that connected the tube to another directional servo.</p>
			<p>In practice, our propulsion system worked well although it was weaker than we had expected it to be due to the large current draw of the servo motors. The wings successfully allowed the Turtle Duck to turn before hitting the wall, although we aren’t sure if this same method would be as functional at higher speeds. Our main issue that held us back in the demonstration was our ability to move in a straight line. Initially our keel was misaligned so we tried to adjust is slightly. Considering the Turtle Duck consistently crossed about half of the pool in a straight line before veering off to the right we think there also may have been a center of mass calculation error causing one side to be heavier than the other. Our other issue that ending up taking up a lot of time in the days preceding the demo was our IR Sensors (used for sensing distance away from the walls). We found them to be unpredictable and sometimes one sensor would stop working and then begin to work without any noticeable changes being made. We found that the other groups had all swapped out their kit sensors for newer ones, so next time we will try different sensors earlier on in the testing process.</p>
