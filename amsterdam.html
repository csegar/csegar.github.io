			<p>I spent the spring of my junior year studying abroad in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I took several classes 
				at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) that I will be creating a humanities concentration out of. While the 
				official language in the Netherlands is Dutch, the classes I took were in English and were comprised 
				of mostly native Dutch students with a few international students (especially in Dutch History). The 
				school system and class structure is a bit different, and most notably there is a lot more independence 
				expected of the students. Assignments mostly involved reading long (although highly engaging) academic 
				papers, and there was an expectation that students would do the reading and come to class prepared to 
				discuss and connect to the lecture. I found that the students often had very strong opinions and were 
				always willing to have an academic discussion surrounding differing views on an issue. There are few 
				assignments given and most of any one course’ grade is placed on a final exam at the end of the term.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>DIVERSITY 1 AND 2</p>
			<p>Two consecutive coursed aimed at several disciplines including: sociology, anthropology, communication sciences, public administration, and political sciences as well as exchange students. I was one of only a few students with a non-humanities background. This didn’t pose a challenge at all in group discussions as I found that doing the readings and coming with well-supported ideas and a willingness to learn was all I needed. My background in fact allowed me to bring something entirely unexpected to our research.</p>
			<p>During the first course, Diversity 1, we learned about the complexities of diversity issues and how they 
				relate to language, perceptions, definitions, power, and politics. We discussed cases of challenging, 
				changing, and often times contradictory issues rooted in processes of in- and exclusion as well as 
				equality and (relative) advantage. In small group sessions, we focused on researching a particular topic.
				Because we needed to provide a discipline-based perspective on the issue, I proposed the topic of 
				gentrification. Together, we researched and discussed this issue, narrowing the topic 
				to <u><a href="csegar.github.io/GentrificationPosterFinal.pdf" target="_blank">How is Gentrification 
				Responsible for Displacing Already Marginalized Communities?</u>.</a>, a topic I was very excited to 
				learn more about coming from the background of a discipline that is often doing more harm than good in 
				this area. We compiled our initial research into a poster that a subset then continued working on in 
				the next session (I was moved to a new group the following session to spread out the distribution of 
				international students).</p>
			<p>During the second course, Diversity 2, we built on our studies of diversity issues to look at how such issues 
				are or should be addressed. As we learned through many case studies, interventions in the issues of 
				diversity are anything but straightforward, and can even have unwanted consequences if executed without 
				proper understanding. In our small groups we worked to build on the previously chosen issue and develop 
				a well-researched potential intervention based on a thorough and critical analysis of the problem. 
				My new group looked at the issue of gender diversity in the financial sector, which we narrowed to the 
				lack of women in executive positions in finance. Specifically, we came up with 
				a <u><a href="csegar.github.io/ING-intervention.pdf" target="_blank">proposed intervention for ING 
				Group</u>.</a>, a Dutch banking company, considering they had made previous failed attempts at trying 
				to tackle this issue themselves.</p>
			<p> </p>
			
			<p>CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</p>
			<p>A third year course for sociology, cultural anthropology, and political science majors. This class was mostly 
				comprised of native Dutch students, so my unique background both as an American and as an engineering 
				major allowed me to both provide an entirely new perspective as well as learn a lot from the diverse 
				backgrounds of my classmates.</p>
			<p>Starting with an introduction to the foundational debates on the notion of ‘justice’ in normative theory 
				(universalism versus relativism, deontology versus consequentialism, monism versus value pluralism), 
				the course then focused on the following contested issues both on a national (based in the Netherlands) 
				and international level:</p>
			<p>1. Cultural diversity and moral universalism: How to reconcile the claim of 'universal human rights' with the 
				fact of and demand for cultural, ethnic and religious diversity and collective rights?</p>
			<p>2. Social equality: What is a 'fair' and 'just' distribution of socio-economic goods?</p>
			<p>3. Democracy: What are the challenges of (neoliberal) globalization and populism to the idea of democracy?</p>
			<p>Weekly assignments consisted of reading research papers in the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, or 
				political science. Class times were spent with lecturers (frequently guest lecturers speaking on their 
				own topic) and class discussions of the underlying ethics and implications of these theories.</p>
			<p>Within this course I wrote an Op-Ed I titled <u><a href="csegar.github.io/feministCrusade.pdf" target="_blank">Feminism: 
				Western Meddling or Honorable Crusade?</u>.</a> for an assignment where “student takes position in a 
				contemporary public discussion within the thematic of this course (cultural diversity, social inequality 
				or democracy)” I chose to focus on the intersection of cultural relativism and Western feminist principles 
				and how these can be reconciled with local cultural values.</p>
